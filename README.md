# Project Title
Pre-Event Planner (PEP)

## Overview
Pre-Event Planner (PEP) is an itinerary builder that transforms planning chaos into coordinated elegance, ensuring patrons reach their live events seamlessly. 

### Problem

Planning the journey to a live event such as a concert, theatre show or sports game, can become a time-consuming endeavour in trying to answer questions like: What's the fastest way to get there? What are my transportation options? Is there parking nearby? Where should I eat? This can become even more challenging when a patron is travelling to an unfamiliar area and has to do ample research beforehand.

### User Profile

- Live event enthusiasts:
    - seeking a streamlined solution for efficient pre-event planning
    - who prefer a centralized platform for mapping out their event-related logistics
    - desiring a hassle-free experience by consolidating event-related information

### Features

- As a user, I want to be able to map my route from any given location to the event venue based on my desired arrival time 
- As a user, I want the flexibility to choose my preferred mode(s) of transportation to the venue, whether it's driving, public transit, walking or biking
- As a user, I want to be able to consider parking options if I choose to drive within a 1.6km or 1-mile radius of the venue
- As a user, I want to be able to select a parking lot from the options if I choose to drive and add it to the itinerary
- As a user, I want to be able to search for restaurant options if I want to eat before the event within a 1.6km or 1-mile radius of the venue
- As a user, I want to be able to select a restaurant from the options if I want to eat before the event and add it to the itinerary
- As a user, I want to be able to dynamically calculate the total distance and time required for the entire journey, factoring in all selected pre-event locations
- As a user, I want to be able to receive a detailed itinerary that includes transportation details, parking information (if needed), selected restaurant, and estimated arrival times at each location **
